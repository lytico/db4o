        <h1>Wrong Approach</h1>
        <p>The wrong approach is to try to store disconnected objects. db4o manages object by their <a href="../../basics/identity_concept.htm">object-identity</a> and doesn't recognize objects which have been serialized or loaded by another object container instance. This example shows, that instead of updating the object, db4o will store a new instance of the object. </p>

        <p>So in order to update an object, you need to load and store it in the same object-container. If you cannot do this, you need to merge to object-changes. <MadCap:xref href="example_merge_changes.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "Example Merge Changes"</MadCap:xref></p>
