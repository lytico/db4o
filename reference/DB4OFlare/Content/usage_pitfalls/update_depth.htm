        <h1>Update Depth Pitfall</h1>
        <p>db4o update behavior is regulated by
<a href="../basics/update_concept.htm">Update Depth</a>. Understanding update depth
will help you to improve performance and avoid unnecessary memory
usage. A common pitfall is that the update-depth is to small and that the objects are not updated. In such cases you either need to explicitly store the 
related objects individually or <a href="../configuration/common/update_depth.htm">increase the update-depth</a>.</p>
        <p>For example in this code we add a new friend and store the object. Since a collection is also handled like a regular object, it is affected by the update-depth. In this example we only store the person-object, but not the friend-collection-object. Therefore with the default-update depth of one the update isn't store. In order to update this properly, you either need to set the update depth to two or store the friend-list explicitly. </p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../CodeExamples/pitfalls/updatedepth/UpdateDepthPitfall-Update-doesn't-work-on-collection.all.flsnp" />
        <p>So for this example setting the update-depth to two will fix the issue. For lots of operation a update-depth of two is pretty reasonable. This allows you to update collections without storing them explicitly.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../CodeExamples/pitfalls/updatedepth/UpdateDepthPitfall-A-higher-update-depth-fixes-the-issue.all.flsnp" />
        <p>When the update depth is set to a big value
on objects with a deep reference hierarchy it will cause each update
on the top-level object to trigger updates on the lower-level
objects, which can impose a huge performance penalty. 
</p>
        <p>Try <a href="../basics/update_concept/transparent_persistence.htm">transparent persistence</a>, which removes the issue of the update-depth completly. </p>
