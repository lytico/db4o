        <h1>Patch Submission</h1>
        <p>This topic explains how to prepare your patch.</p>
        <p>Before writing a patch, please, familiarize yourself with our Coding Style conventions. </p>
        <p>You can create a patch using "Create Patch" SVN command. </p>
        <p>If you are using <A href="http://www.polarion.org/index.php?page=overview&amp;project=subversive">Subversive</A> plugin you can use the following steps:</p>
        <UL>
            <LI>select the project in Package Explorer;</LI>
            <LI>right-click and select Team/Create Patch;</LI>
            <LI>select "Save In File System" and choose the file name;</LI>
            <LI>click "Next" and "Finish";</LI>
            <LI>check unversioned resources that should be included in the patch;</LI>
            <LI>click "OK"</LI>
        </UL>
        <p>Once the patch is created you should register the functionality provided with our <A href="http://tracker.db4o.com/secure/Dashboard.jspa">Jira tracking system</A> by creating  new issue, submitting the description, patch and <A href="db4o_testing_framework.htm">test case</A> if applicable.</p>
