        <h1>Browsing A Database</h1>
        <p>Suppose you have a simple database file containing Pilot and Car objects. Please select OME-&gt;Connect/Disconnect DB (or
use a shortcut button from the toolbar menu) and browse to your database file. </p>
        <p>Once you've connected you will
see a screen similar to this:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="ome_pilot.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The db4o Browser window in the picture above shows that there is 1
class in the database (Pilot), which contains 2 fields: name and points. In the
Property Viewer you can see more information about the class fields. You can
also change "Is indexed" field and add the index to the database by pressing
"Save Index" button.</p>
        <p>The filter panel on the top of the view allows
easier navigation through the database with lots of different classes. You can
use wildcard searches and benefit from the search history to make the selection
faster.</p>
