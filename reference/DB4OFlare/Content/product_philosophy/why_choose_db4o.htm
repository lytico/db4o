        <h1>Why Choose db4o</h1>
        <p>There are many advantages of using "native" object technology over RDBMS or RDBMS paired with an OR mapper, and these technological advantages significantly impact an organization's competitiveness and bottom line. </p>
        <p>First, object databases not only simplify development by eliminating the resource-consuming OR-mismatch entirely, but they also foster more sophisticated  and differentiated  product development through gains in flexibility and productivity brought on by "true" object-orientation. </p>
        <p>Second, with an object database, the object schema is the same as the data model. Developers can easier update their models to meet changing requirements, or for purposes of debugging or refactoring. db4o lets developers work with object structures almost as if they were "in-memory"' structures. Little additional coding is required to manage object persistence. As a result, companies can add new features to their products faster to stay ahead of the competition. </p>
        <p>Third, developers can now use object-oriented and entirely native approaches when it comes to querying, since db4o was the first in the industry to provide Native Queries (NQ) with its Version 5.0 launched in November 2005 and since introduction of LINQ in .NET version 3.5. Db4o Native Queries provide an API that uses the programming languages Java or .NET to access the database. No time is spent on learning a separate data manipulation or query language. Unlike incumbent, string-based, non-native APIs (such as SQL, OQL, JDOQL and others) Native Queries and LINQ are 100% type-safe, 100% refactorable and 100% object-oriented, boosting developer productivity by up to 30%. In addition, the sophisticated modern programming development environments can be used to simplify the development and maintenance work even further.</p>
        <p>Fourth,  db4o's ground-breaking object-oriented replication technology solves
problems arising from distributed data architectures. Partially
connected devices need to efficiently replicate data with peers or
servers. The challenge lies in the creation of "smart" conflict
resolution algorithms, when redundant data sets are simultaneously
modified and need to be merged. With db4o's OO approach, developers can
build smarter and easier synchronization conflict resolution and embed
the necessary business logic into the data layer, rather than into the
middle-tier or application layer. This creates "smart" objects that can
be stored in a distributed fashion, but easily consolidated, as the
object itself knows how to resolve synchronization conflicts. It also
enables db4o solution on a client to synchronize data with an RDBMS
backend server.</p>
        <p>As a result, developers can now more consistently persist data on
distributed, partially connected clients than ever before, while
decreasing bandwidth requirements and increasing the responsiveness and
reach of their mobile solutions or smart devices to make products more
competitive in the marketplace. </p>
        <p>Fifth, db4o also allows for more complex object models than its relational or non-native counterparts do. As the persistence requirements become more complex, db4o's unique design easily handles (or absorbs) the added complexity, so developers can continue to work as though new complexity were never introduced. Complexity means not only taller object trees and extensive use of inheritance, but also dynamically evolving object models, most extremely if development is taking place under runtime conditions (which makes db4o a leading choice for biotech simulation software, for instance). db4o could be referred to as "agnostic to complexity," because it can automatically handle changes to the data model, without requiring extra work. No type or amount of complexity will change its behavior or restrain its capabilities, as is the case with RDBMS or non-native technology. With db4o breaking through this complexity, developers are able to write more user friendly and business-appropriate software components without incurring such high costs and modify them as needed, throughout the life cycle of the product with the same low cost. </p>
        <p>In sum, db4o's native, object oriented architecture enables its users to build more competitive products with faster update cycles, more natural object models that match more realistically their use cases, and more distributed data architectures to increase the reach of products. db4o is clearly more flexible and powerful for embedded DB applications than any non-native OODBMS or  RDBMS technologies available.</p>
