        <p>The
emergence of distributed data architectures - in networks, on clients and
embedded in "smart" products such as cars or medical devices - is causing
companies in an array of industries to look beyond traditional RDBMS technology
and ORM for an improved way to deal with object persistence. </p>
        <p>They
are searching for a solution that can handle an enormous number of often
complex objects, offer powerful replication and query capabilities, reduce
development and maintenance costs and require minimum to zero administration
overhead.</p>
        <p>These
requirements can be fulfilled by using an Object Oriented Database Management
System (OODBMS). OODBMS provides an ideal match with object oriented
environments like Java and .NET reducing the cost of development, support and
versioning and hence overall system costs.</p>
        <p>Using
OODBMS in software projects also better supports modern Agile software
engineering practices like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Continuous refactoring.</li>
            <li>Agile modeling.</li>
            <li>Continuous regression testing.</li>
            <li>Configuration management.</li>
            <li>Developer "sandboxes".</li>
        </ul>
