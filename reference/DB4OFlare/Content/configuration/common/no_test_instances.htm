    <h1>Test For Constructors</h1>
    <p>This setting is only relevant for some embedded platforms which need a constructor (for example <a href="../../platform_specific_issues/android.htm">Android</a>). </p>
    <p>On startup, db4o checks that the classes have a callable constructor. This may take some time, especially on embedded platforms. When you run in production, you can disable this check, when you are sure that all classes can be instantiated.<br /></p>
