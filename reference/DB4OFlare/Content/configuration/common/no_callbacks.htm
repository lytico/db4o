    <h1>Disable Callbacks</h1>
    <p>db4o supports <a href="../../advanced_topics/callbacks.htm">callback-methods</a> on each class. In order to support this, db4o scans all persistent classes and looks for the callback-method signature. When a lot of different classes are stored, this may take some time, especially on embedded devices. Therefore you can disable the object callbacks, when you don't need them. </p>
    <p>Note that this doesn't disable the <a href="../../advanced_topics/callbacks/event_registry_api.htm">global events</a>. These can still be used, even when callbacks are disabled.</p>
