      <MadCap:keyword term="Batch Mode" />Batch Mode</h1>
    <p>Batch mode allows to increase the performance by reducing
client/server communication. It's activated by default.</p>
    <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../CodeExamples/configuration/network/NetworkConfigurationExample-enable-or-disable-batch-mode.all.flsnp" />
    <p>db4o communicates with the server by
means of messaging. Without batch mode db4o sends a message for each operation and waits for the response. This might be quite inefficient when there are many small messages to
be sent (like bulk inserts, updates, deletes). The network communication becomes a
bottleneck. Batch messaging mode solves this problem by caching the messages and sending them only when required.     <![CDATA[ ]]></p>
    <h2>Advantages</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduced network load.</li>
      <li>Increased performance for bulk operations.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Increased memory consumption on both the client and the server. <MadCap:xref href="max_batch_queue_size.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "Max Batch Queue Size"</MadCap:xref></li>
