        <h1>Refreshing Objects</h1>
        <p>When working with multiple client object-containers each container has its own reference cache. When you query for objects, you get always the cached objects. This means, that objects probably have been updated in the mean-time but the client still sees the old state.</p>
        <p>For some scenarios you might need to refresh to objects to bring it up to date. There are two strategies for this. You can explicit refresh a object at any time. Or you can use callbacks to refresh object on each commit. Both methods have their advantage.</p>

        <h2>Explicitly Refreshing Objects </h2>
        <p>You can refresh objects with the refresh-method on the object-container. The pass the object to refresh and the refresh-depth to the method:</p>

        <h2>Using Callbacks For Refreshing Objects</h2>
        <p>You can use the committed-event to refresh objects as soon as another client commits. Take a look at the example: <MadCap:xref href="../advanced_topics/callbacks/possible_usecases/committed_event_example.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "Committed Event Example"</MadCap:xref></p>
