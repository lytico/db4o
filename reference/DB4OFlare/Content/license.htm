    <h3>db4o Opensource Compatibility License (dOCL)</h3>
    <p>The db4o Opensource Compatibility License (dOCL) is designed for free/open source projects that want to embed db4o but do not want to (or are
not able to) license their derivative work under the GPL in its entirety. This
initiative aims to proliferate db4o into many more open source projects by
providing compatibility for projects licensed under Apache, LGPL, BSD, EPL, and
others, as required by our users. </p>The terms of this license are available here: <a href="http://www.db4o.com/about/company/legalpolicies/docl.aspx">"dOCL"
