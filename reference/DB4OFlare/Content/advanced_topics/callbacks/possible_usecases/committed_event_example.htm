        <h1>Committed Event Example</h1>
        <p>Committed callbacks can be used in various scenarios:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Backup on commit.</li>
            <li>Client database synchronization.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This example shows you how to refresh objects on a client on commits.</p>
        <p>When several clients are working
on the same objects it is possible that the data will be outdated on a client. You can use the committed-event refresh object on each commit. </p>
        <p>When a client commit will trigger a committed event on all clients. In order to refresh the object, register for the committed event. In the commit-event-handler, refresh the object which have been modified.</p>

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../CodeExamples/clientserver/refresh/RefreshingObjects-The-refresh-handler.all.flsnp" />
        <p>You can register such a event-handler for each client. The committed event is transferred to each client. Note that this requires a lot of network-traffic to notify all clients and transfer the changes.</p>
        <p>When working with committed events you should remember that
the listener is called on a separate thread, which needs to be synchronized
with the rest of the application.</p>
