            <MadCap:keyword term="Enhancement" />Enhancement Tools</h1>
        <p>Enhancement tools provide a convenient framework for application (jar, dll, exe) or classes modification to support db4o-specific functionality. Enhancement tools can work on a ready application or library and apply the improvements at load or build time.  </p>
        <p>The tools functionality is provided through <MadCap:variable name="Primary.ByteCode" /> instrumentation. This process inserts special, usually
short, sequences of <MadCap:variable name="Primary.ByteCode" /> at designated points in your code. It is
typically used for profiling or monitoring, however the range of use of
<MadCap:variable name="Primary.ByteCode" /> instrumentation is not limited by this tasks: it can be applied
anywhere where a specific functionality should be plugged into the ready built
classes.</p>
        <p>db4o Enhancement Tools currently have these cases for <MadCap:variable name="Primary.ByteCode" />instrumentation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="../basics/activation_concept/transparent_activation_framework.htm">Transparent
Activation</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="../basics/update_concept/transparent_persistence.htm">Transparent Persistence</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="../basics/querying/native_queries/native_query_optimization.htm">Native Query Optimization </a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In <a href="../basics/update_concept/transparent_persistence.htm">transparent activation/persistence case</a>, classes are required
to implement <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Activatable" /> interface to support transparent activation. In many
cases you don't want to pollute your classes with some additional
interface, or even won't be able to do so if you use a third party classes
library. That's where bytecode instrumentation comes handy: <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Activatable" />interface will be implemented
on your existing classes by applying bytecode instrumentation. Another
advantage of this approach - you can still work on your "clean" classes, just
do not forget to run the instrumentation afterwards.</p>
        <p>In the native query optimization case bytecode
instrumentation is used as a more performant alternative to a run-time
optimization. When an native query is optimized the user and compiler-friendly syntax of
NQ predicate is replaced with a query-processor-friendly code. Obviously, optimization process can take some time, therefore it
can be a good choice to use pre-instrumented classes, then to let the
optimization be executed each time it is required by application.</p>
        <p>
            <p>The instrumentation can be run at build time, also known as static
instrumentation. In this case a special build script calls runs the instrumentation on the classes
before packaging them to <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Artefact" />, or on the <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Artefact" /> itself. This is the fastest solution as no time is
spent on bytecode instrumentation at runtime. </p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.Java">Another method is to use bytecode instrumentation at load time. In this case
instrumenting information is inserted into the classes by a specific
instrumenting classloader just before they are loaded into the VM.</p>
        </p>
        <p>There are different possibilities to integrate the enhancement tools into a project.</p>
