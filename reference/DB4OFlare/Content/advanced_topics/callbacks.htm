        <p>Callbacks, also known as events, allow you to be notified on certain database operations. This is useful to trigger additional operations during a database operation. There are two kind of callbacks. First you can certain methods to your objects. When the method matches certain signature it will be called by db4o. <MadCap:xref href="callbacks/object_callbacks.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "Object Callbacks"</MadCap:xref></p>
        <p>Additionally you can register event listener to a object-container which will be called on certain operations. <MadCap:xref href="callbacks/event_registry_api.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "Event Registry API"</MadCap:xref></p>
