        <p>Unfortunately this implementation is not very efficient for searches/updates of a certain value in a collection, as the whole collection needs to be instantiated to access any of its elements.</p>
        <p>db4o brings some special collections with it. There are collections which support transparent persistence. <MadCap:xref href="../../basics/transparentpersistence/Collections.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "Transparent Persistence Aware Collections"</MadCap:xref></p>
        <p>When you have a need for a huge collection, you might run into some performance bottleneck, since collections are always stored and retrieved as complete unit. You can use db4o special big-set to improve performance. <MadCap:xref href="collections/big_set.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "Big Set"</MadCap:xref></p>
        <p>You might wonder what is better to use, collection or arrays. Most of times it doesn't matter. <MadCap:xref href="collections/collections_or_arrays.htm" target="" title="" alt="">See "Collections Or Arrays"</MadCap:xref></p>
