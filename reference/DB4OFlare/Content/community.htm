        <h2>Report Bugs</h2>
        <p>Every software contains bugs and so does db4o. If you find bugs please report them to us. In case you're not sure if you really found a bug, you maybe want to discuss your issue first on the <a href="http://community.versant.com/Forums.aspx" target="_parent">db4o forum</a>. As soon as you're sure that you found a bug it best to report in <a href="http://tracker.db4o.com/" target="_parent">our bug-tracking system</a>. The login is the same as in the db4o forums. Read more on tips and tricks for reporting bugs <a href="community/report_bugs.htm">here</a>.</p>
        <p>When possible include a small test program which reproduces the issue with the bug report. A test case avoids confusion and effort to reproduce the bug. </p>
