        <p>Isolation
imposes rules which ensure that transactions do not interfere with each other
even if they are executed at the same time. Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_level" target="_parent">isolation levels on Wikipedia</a>. </p>
        <p>db4o uses the read committed isolation level, on an object level. That's means db4o has a very weak isolation. It ensures that you do not see uncommitted objects of other transactions. However it does not guarantee any consistency across different objects. </p>
