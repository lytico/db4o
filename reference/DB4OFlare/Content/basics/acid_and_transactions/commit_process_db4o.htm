        <h1> db4o's Commit Process</h1>
        <p>How does db4o make transactions safe, so that it can recover failures? Here's the short overview of the transaction-phases db4o uses.</p>

        <p>Of course you don't need to worry about this. db4o ensures that a transaction either completes or is rolled back. Whenever you call commit and the call succeeds, all changes are persisted. If your application or db4o crashes before a successfully commit-call, all changes are undone. </p>
