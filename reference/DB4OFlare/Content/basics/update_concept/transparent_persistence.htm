            <MadCap:keyword term="Persistence" />Transparent Persistence</h1>
        <p>One of db4o's goals is to make the database transparent to the
application logic. Wouldn't it be nice to initially register an
object  with a single store()-call and then let the database manage all future object modifications? Transparent Persistence does exactly that.It keeps track of changes and stores all modified objects automatically when committing. </p>
        <p>This has several benefits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clean an refactorable code. The code doesn't depend on the right activation-depth. </li>
            <li>Performance-benefits. Only the objects which are needed are loaded into memory. And only modified objects are stored.</li>
            <li>No changes can be lost due to miss configured update-depth.</li>
        </ul>
