        <h1>Bidirectional Replication</h1>
        <p>In order to replicate objects from Hibernate to db4o you need to do some additional work. dRS needs to know which objects have changed since the last replication. For this some   <![CDATA[ ]]><a href="drs_internals.htm">meta data</a> <![CDATA[ ]]>is maintained.You need to register a dRS event handler on every Hibernate-session you're using. This listener will maintain the meta-data. If an object is stored on a session without this listener, the update is not replicated. That also means dRS replication only works when you persist all object through Hibernate</p>

        <p>After that dRS is ready to replicate in both directions. Again, set up the replication-session. After that you can replicate the changes of the two providers in both directions.</p>
