        <h1>Indexes</h1>
        <p>With indexes we can speed up queries. As soon as we have lots of objects and query them we need indexes.</p>
        <p>Indexes are a tradeoff: An index makes queries orders of magnitudes faster, but it slows down updates and inserts of those objects. </p>
        <h2>Index Annotation</h2>
        <p>We can add an <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Annotation" /> on a field in order to index that field. 
		<span MadCap:conditions="Primary..NET">Currently we cannot annotate auto proprieties.
			We should use regular properties with a backing field when storing objects in db4o.</span></p>
