        We reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR--it is fully in the public domain. An individual
        or company may do whatever they wish with source code distributed with ANTLR or
        the code generated by ANTLR, including the incorporation of ANTLR, or its output,
        into commerical software.
    </p>
    <p>
        We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However, we do ask that credit
        is given to us for developing ANTLR. By "credit", we mean that if you use ANTLR
        or incorporate any source code into one of your programs (commercial product, research
        project, or otherwise) that you acknowledge this fact somewhere in the documentation,
        research report, etc... If you like ANTLR and have developed a nice tool with the
        output, please mention that you developed it using ANTLR.
        In addition, we ask that
        the headers remain
        intact in our source code. As long as these guidelines are kept,
        we expect to continue enhancing this system and expect to make other tools available
        as they are completed.
