Getting Started
----------------------------------

For the fastest start with db4o please work through the tutorial, 
available in different formats in the following folder:
./doc/tutorial/

If you  are working with db4o for Java, it is recommended to use
the interactive HTML tutorial:
./doc/tutorial/index.html

If you are working with db4o for .NET, it is recommended to run
the tutorial program:
./doc/tutorial/db4o-X.x-tutorial.exe

The PDF tutorial will work best for fulltext search:
./doc/tutorial/db4o-X.x-tutorial.pdf
