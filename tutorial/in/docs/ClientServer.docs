.0 Client/Server ..

Now that we have seen how transactions work in db4o conceptually, we ._
are prepared to tackle concurrently executing transactions.

We start by preparing our database in the familiar way.

.1 Embedded server ..

From the API side, there's no real difference between transactions ._
executing concurrently within the same  .? java  VM ..?  .? net runtime ..?  and transactions executed ._
against a remote server. To use concurrent transactions within ._
a single  .? java  VM ..?  .? net runtime ..? , we just open a db4o server on our database file, ._
directing it to run on port 0, thereby declaring that no networking ._
will take place.

.s com.db4odoc.f1.chapter6.ClientServerExample#accessLocalServer -run ..

Again, we will delegate opening and closing the server to our ._
environment to focus on client interactions.

.s com.db4odoc.f1.chapter6.ClientServerExample#queryLocalServer ..

The transaction level in db4o is  .i read committed ..  . However, each ._
client container maintains its own weak reference cache of already known ._
objects. To make all changes committed by other clients immediately, we ._
have to explicitly refresh known objects from the server. We will delegate ._
this task to a specialized version of our .x #listResult() .. method.

.s com.db4odoc.f1.Util#listRefreshedResult +{} -run ..

.s com.db4odoc.f1.chapter6.ClientServerExample#demonstrateLocalReadCommitted ..

Simple rollbacks just work as you might expect now.

.s com.db4odoc.f1.chapter6.ClientServerExample#demonstrateLocalRollback ..

.1 Networking ..

From here it's only a small step towards operating db4o over a TCP/IP network. ._
We just specify a port number greater than zero ._
and set up one or more accounts for our client(s).

.s com.db4odoc.f1.chapter6.ClientServerExample#accessRemoteServer -run ..

The client connects providing host, port, user name and password.

.s com.db4odoc.f1.chapter6.ClientServerExample#queryRemoteServer ..

Everything else is absolutely identical to the local server examples above.

.1 Native Queries in Client/Server mode ..1

A quite subtle problem may occur if you're using Native Queries as anonymous (or just non-static) inner ._
classes in Client/Server mode. Anonymous/non-static inner class instances carry a synthetic field ._
referencing their outer class instance - this is just Java's way of implementing inner class access ._
to fields or final method locals of the outer class without introducing any notion of inner classes ._
at all at the bytecode level. If such a non-static inner class predicate cannot be converted to ._
S.O.D.A. form on the client, it will be wrapped into an evaluation and passed to the server, ._
introducing the same problem already mentioned in the  .l Evaluations evaluation chapter ..l : ._
db4o will try to transfer the evaluation, using the standard platform serialization mechanism. ._
If this fails, it will just try to pass it to the server via db4o marshalling. However, this ._
may fail, too, for example if the outer class references any local db4o objects like ._
ObjectContainer, etc., resulting in an ObjectNotStorableException.

So to be on the safe side with NQs in C/S mode, you should declare Predicates as top-level ._
or static inner classes only. Alternatively, you could either make sure that the outer ._
classes containing Predicate definitions could principally be persisted to db4o, too, ._
and don't add significant overhead to the predicate (the appropriate value for 'significant'
being your choice) or ensure during development that all predicates used actually can ._
be optimized to S.O.D.A. form.

.1 Out-of-band signalling ..

Sometimes a client needs to send a special message to a server in order ._
to tell the server to do something.  The server may need to be signalled ._
to perform a defragment or it may need to be signalled to shut itself ._
down gracefully.

This is configured by .? java calling #messageRecipient() , passing the object ._
that will process client-initiated messages. ..?  .? net setting MessageRecipient parameter to the object that will process client-initiated messages. .. 

.s com.db4odoc.f1.chapter6.StartServer#run -run +{} ..s

The message is received and processed by a .x #processMessage() .. method:

.s com.db4odoc.f1.chapter6.StartServer#processMessage -run +{} ..s

Db4o allows a client to send an arbitrary signal or message to a server ._
by sending a plain object to the server.  The server will receive ._
a callback message, including the object that came from the client. ._
The server can interpret this message however it wants.

.s com.db4odoc.f1.chapter6.StopServer#main -run +{} ..s

.1 Putting it all together: a simple but complete db4o server ..

Let's put all of this information together now to implement a simple ._
standalone db4o server with a special client that can tell the server ._
to shut itself down gracefully on demand.

First, both the client and the server need some shared configuration ._
information.  We will provide this using an interface:

.s com.db4odoc.f1.chapter6.ServerInfo ..s

Now we'll create the server:

.s com.db4odoc.f1.chapter6.StartServer ..s

And last but not least, the client that stops the server.

.s com.db4odoc.f1.chapter6.StopServer ..s

.1 Conclusion ..

That's it, folks. No, of course it isn't. There's much more to db4o ._
we haven't covered yet: schema evolution, custom persistence for your classes, ._
writing your own query objects, etc. A much more thorough documentation is ._
provided in the reference that you should have also received with the ._
download or  .l http://developer.db4o.com/Documentation.aspx online .. .

We hope that this tutorial has helped to get you started with db4o. How ._
should you continue now?

- Register on db4o developer  .l http://www.db4o.com/Users/register.aspx website .. . 

- You could browse the remaining chapters. They are a selection of themes ._
from the reference that very frequently come up as questions in ._
our  .l http://developer.db4o.com/Forums.aspx .. .

- .i (Interactive version only) .. While this tutorial is basically sequential in ._
nature, try to switch back and forth between the chapters and execute the ._
sample snippets in arbitrary order. You will be working with the same ._
database throughout; sometimes you may just get stuck or even induce ._
exceptions, but you can always reset the database via the console window.

- The examples we've worked through are included in your db4o distribution ._
in full source code. Feel free to experiment with it.

- If you're stuck, browse the information ._
on our  .l http://www.db4o.com/ web site .. , check if your problem is submitted ._
to  .l http://tracker.db4o.com/ Jira ..  or visit our ._
