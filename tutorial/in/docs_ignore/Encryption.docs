.0 Encryption ..

db4o provides built-in encryption functionality. This feature is ._
easy to turn on or off, and must be configured before opening a ._
database file.

db4o currently provides two different encryption algorithms, in ._
in addition to providing the ability for you to plug in your own ._
encrypting IO Adapters.

.1 eXtended Tiny Encryption Algorithm ..

The first included encryption algorithm is XTEA (eXtended Tiny ._
Encryption Algorithm). We have choosen XTEA because this block ._
cipher operates on a 64-bit block size with a 128-bit key. This ._
is an extremely tiny but very fast (with cycles less than 32 rounds) ._
encryption algorithm. It is supposed to be as secure as DES or IDEA. ._
Since cryptography is beyond the scope of this tutorial you can find ._
further information about XTEA here:

.l http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XTEA ..
	
In order to encipher your data just perform the following steps:

1)	Ensure you have downloaded at least db4o Version 5.1. This is the ._
first version which includes the XTeaEncryptionFileAdapter (the encryption ._
IoAdapter plug-in for db4o file IO that realizes XTEA).

2)	Configure db4o to add this encryption mechanism:
.c Db4o.configure ().io(new XTeaEncryptionFileAdapter(�password�)); ..
This is the simplest way to add the encryption adapter. But the ._
XTEAEncryptionFileAdapter can also wrap other custom IoAdapters to use:
.c Db4o.configure ().io(new XTeaEncryptionFileAdapter(new myIoAdapter(),"password")); ..

3)	Choose your own password and number of cycles. The security of XTEA ._
can be enhanced by increasing the number of iterations. There are four ._
possible values: 
- 8 rounds guarantee highest speed of db4o and lowest security ._
(iterations = XTEA.ITERATIONS8).
- 16 rounds assure high speed of db4o and sufficient security in the same ._
time (iterations = XTEA.ITERATIONS16).
- 32 rounds are ample for most applications, this is the default value ._
(iterations = XTEA.ITERATIONS32).
- 64 rounds achieve the best security but db4o will be about 20 per cent ._
slower then without encryption (iterations = XTEA.ITERATIONS64).
.c Db4o.configure ().io(new XTeaEncryptionFileAdapter( �password�, iteraions) ); ..
Or, if you wish to use your own IoAdapter:
.c Db4o.configure ().io(new XTeaEncryptionFileAdapter(new myIoAdapter(), �password�, iteraions) ); ..

Keep in mind that all configurations must be set before opening the ObjectContainer.

Note that there are some limitations you should keep in mind:
There is no possibility of changing the password on an existing file. You will not ._
be able to access your data if you lose the password. Thus please keep your key! ._
And make sure that you always use the same password when subsequently opening your ._
encrypted files. You can, however open a new file with a different password and ._
.l Replication replicate ..  (or .l Defragment defragment .. ) your ._
objects from one database to the other.

Feel free to use XTeaEncryptionFileAdapter for your own purposes. You may modify the ._
class XTEA (which implement the XTEA encryption algorithm) and KeyGenerator (for key ._
generation), and replace them with other algorithms if you like. Feel free to post ._
your own IoAdapters to the .l http://forums.db4o.com/forums db4o Community Fourm .. .


.1 Built-In Simple Encryption ..

The other encryption methods built-into db4o, is called simple ._
encryption. To use it, the following two methods have to be called, ._
before a database file is created: 
.c Db4o.configure().encrypt(true);
Db4o.configure().password("yourEncryptionPasswordHere"); ..

The security standard of the built-in encryption functionality ._
is not very high, not much more advanced than ._
"substract 5 from every byte". This is great for systems with limited ._
resources, or where the encryption needs to be done as quickly as possible.

.1 Custom Encryption Adapters ..

db4o still provides a solution for high-security encryption by ._
allowing any user to choose his own encryption mechanism that ._
he thinks he needs. The db4o file IO mechanism is pluggable and any fixed-length ._
encryption mechanism can be added. All that needs ._
to be done is to write an IoAdapter plugin for db4o file IO.

This is a lot easier than it sounds. Simply:
- take the sources of com.db4o.io.RandomAccessFileAdapter as an example
- write your own IoAdapter implementation that delegates raw file ._
access to another adapter using the GoF decorator pattern.
- Implement the #read() and #write() methods to encrypt and decrypt ._
when bytes are being exchanged with the file
- plug your adapter into db4o with the following method:
.c Db4o.configure().io(new MyEncryptionAdapter()); ..

However, you'll have to keep in mind that db4o will write partial udates. ._
For example, it may write a full object and then only modify one field ._
entry later one. Therefore it is not sufficient to en-/decrypt each access ._
in isolation. You'll rather have to make up a tiling structure that defines ._
the data chunks that have to be en-/decrypted together.

Another method to inject encryption capabilities into db4o for instances ._
of specific classes only is to implement and configure an en-/decrypting ._
translator.
