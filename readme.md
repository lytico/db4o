With regret we have to announce that Actian decided not to actively pursue and promote the commercial db4o product offering for new customers any longer.
Since the db4o dual licensing model allows for the free usage of the community edition of db4o for non-commercial purposes, you have the opportunity to continue to use it for your non-commercial applications or even fork it to provide support for the community.
For a limited time, you can find the subversion repository under https://source.db4o.com/db4o and the latest installer packages including the source tarball for Java, .NET35, .NET40
